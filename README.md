# Emotion Detection: A Comparative Analysis

### A comprehensive analysis of Machine Learning and Transformer models for multi-label emotion detection on the GoEmotions dataset.

This repository contains the code and resources for the project "Emotion Detection: A Comparative Analysis," which evaluates the performance of classic machine learning models against modern Transformer architectures. The key achievement of this project is a fine-tuned RoBERTa model that demonstrates high sensitivity with a state-of-the-art recall score.

## üöÄ Features

- **Comprehensive Analysis:** Compares 4 different models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, DistilBERT, and RoBERTa).
- **Multi-Label Classification:** Tackles the complex task of predicting multiple emotions for a single piece of text.
- **In-Depth EDA:** Includes detailed Exploratory Data Analysis on the GoEmotions dataset, highlighting the severe class imbalance.
- **High-Recall Model:** The fine-tuned RoBERTa model achieves a weighted average recall of 0.66, demonstrating high sensitivity.
- **Code:** All code is provided in easy-to-follow Jupyter/Colab notebooks.

## üìñ Methodology

The project workflow is divided into two parallel approaches:

1.  **Classic Machine Learning Baseline:**
    - Text is vectorized using **TF-IDF**.
    - **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** models are trained using a `MultiOutputClassifier`.

2.  **Transformer Fine-Tuning:**
    - Text is tokenized using specific tokenizers for **DistilBERT** and **RoBERTa**.
    - The pre-trained models are fine-tuned on the GoEmotions dataset using PyTorch and Hugging Face.

## üìä Results

The results clearly show the superiority of Transformer models. Our fine-tuned **RoBERTa** model achieved the best performance, most notably a high recall score, indicating its effectiveness at identifying emotions.


A key finding was the **precision-recall trade-off**, a direct consequence of the dataset's class imbalance. While our model excels at finding emotions (high recall), it sometimes over-predicts, leading to lower precision.
